# Category Join Group

This plugin allows users to join a group of the same name as a category from the category view.

This means that some category might require group membership to write in it (so that moderators can manually filter users that can write) and users won't have to search for the corresponding groups in group view.

## Installation

1. Install this plugin via the ACP page of your NodeBB installation.
2. Activate and reload your NodeBB
